The goal of this mod is to add elements of uniqueness and realism to the early game while also providing a foundation for gathering resources for other mods. Now let's get into why you are really here, to figure out what the heck to do. You can check JEI and the advancements for additional help."

      "text": "Ah yes, a very classic starting tool system: flint. You will need these tools to survive the first few days since vanilla tools are disabled by default. Additionally, this will make you appreciate technological progress just that little bit more. Begin by finding flint (4 are needed at minimum). Traditionally flint is derived from gravel at a 10% chance."

With rope, flint and sticks, any of the flint tools can be made (see the Tools category for more info on different tools). The priority should be to make a pick for for a few reasons, it has a chance to drop flint when mining stones, you need stone to craft the Stone Hammer, and you can mine Native Ores to begin your metallurgic adventures."

These will be used to create an $(l:machines/alloy_furnace)Alloy Furnace$() and a $(l:machines/beehive_oven)Beehive Oven$(). Make Beehive Ovens early and possibly multiple to stockpile resources needed for later. Also, coke is a good fuel so you might as well convert all of your subbituminous and bituminous coal to coke. Also craft a $(l:machines:coal_forge)Coal Forge$() and the corresponding tool templates."

The ores available to you now include malachite, cassiterite, bauxite, and sphalerite. Most Rankine mineral ores have to be crushed to yield their mineral which is then smelted in a blast furnace. $(l:exploration/meteorites)Meteorites$() contain an ore that can be used directly to make Meteoric Iron tools, which is equivalent to vanilla iron tools.

In order to do so, you will need to make higher tier Refractory Bricks using materials such as Magnesia or Dolomite. You will need 40 high refractory brick to make the crucible, which is used to make Crucible Steel. You will also need to produce Pig Iron and Wrought Iron."

    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Pig Iron is made by blasting an Iron Ingot in the blast furnace, and Wrought Iron is made from crushing Sponge Iron in a Piston Crusher. Sponge Iron is produced by cooking a Block of Pig Iron via a Beehive Oven Pit. Once the Crucible is constructed, place it above a heat source (fire, lava, magma blocks) and right-click with a Pig Iron Ingot in your hand. This will produce molten Pig Iron, which you can then right-click with Wrought Iron in order to produce Steel."

    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "You can use three Wrought Iron Ingots per Pig Iron used in the Crucible to make three Steel. At this point, you may make Steel tools to gain greater access to the ores in the world. At this point, you may explore the rest of Project Rankine, such as making some of the multiblock structures like the Evaporation Tower or Laser Quarry, or tinker with alloys to make even stronger tools. The End and Nether also contain additional materials which may aid you in discovery. Good luck!"
